# Installation notes

Next:
* More treesitter textobjects
  * you only did the first part (selection) - there is more:
    * movements
    * some kind of LSP interop to show a floating definition preview
* Telescope
  * More setup - you only did an initial pass
* nvim-autopairs via cmp

Other interesting completion sources:
* Find more on the nvim-cmp wiki

Improvements to make:
  * Try to get a good keymap for expand and shrink selection
