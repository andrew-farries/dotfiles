# Fish notes

Notes I took when learning about the [fish shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell).

* `and`, `or` job modifiers.
* `seq` command (not actually a fish builtin)
* `funced` and `funcsave`
* `alias` command
* `ALT-UP` for fetching previous arguments
* `ALT-LEFT/RIGHT` for going forward and back in directory history.
* create a function with `-w` argument to wrap a command and inherit its completions.
* `-v` to create a function that runs whenever a variable changes!
* The whole event system needs more investigation.
* `fish_update_completions`
* `fish_config`
